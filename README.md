#Kernout

##Synopsis
Kernout is a novelty script written in Python designed to print a random Linux kernel 1.0 source file with user configurable timing between lines printed and number of times the file is printed to the screen. It can also print a random Linux kernel 0.01 source file or any other C language file with the same options. All source is printed with full syntax highlighting by default.

##Usage
Run the kernout.py script with Python3. Requires [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) library. Install pygments with "pip install pygments".
